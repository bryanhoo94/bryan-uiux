> **Additional context needed**: quality bar and shipping constraints.

Polish is refinement, never concealed redesign. Preserve the incumbent visual world, content, behavior, and everything outside scope. If the concept itself is wrong, say so and recommend redesign (`references/visual/redesign/index.md`) or `bolder` instead of smuggling in a replacement.

A checklist result is defect evidence, not proof of quality. Inspect the rendered experience and real interaction path.

## 1. Establish the system

Read DESIGN.md and representative tokens, shared components, patterns, and neighboring flows. If no formal system exists, use coherent project conventions. If DESIGN.md exists, its tokens are locked: polish brings the surface back to them and does not change them.

Classify each drift before fixing it:

- **missing token:** the system needs a reusable value;
- **one-off implementation:** an existing shared component or pattern should replace it;
- **conceptual mismatch:** the flow, information architecture, or hierarchy differs from comparable product areas;
- **local defect:** the implementation is simply incomplete or inconsistent.

Fix the cause at the narrowest correct level. Ask when a binding system principle cannot be inferred.

## 2. Gather the evidence

Use the feature yourself at the surface's representative sizes: desktop (1440px wide) and phone (390px wide) on the web; on a native platform (`ios` / `android` / `adaptive`), the shipped device classes on the simulator, emulator, or hardware, captured per the Verifying the build section of [ios.md](ios.md) / [android.md](android.md). Determine:

- whether the path is functionally complete;
- the intended quality bar and time available;
- known constraints or deliberately unfinished work;
- the states, content lengths, roles, and input methods users will actually encounter.

Take the backlog from the findings in the current conversation (the `critique` and `audit` reports, and what the user picked from them), or from the list the user gives. Nothing is read from disk: no program stores critique results. If the target has changed since a finding was written, re-check that finding before acting on it. Incorporate the findings the user picked (when the user has not picked, the relevant P0/P1 findings) and name the report they came from. With no findings on hand, say so. Perform an independent pass either way.

## 3. Triage

Separate functional defects from cosmetic ones and fix in this order:

1. broken or blocked tasks, data loss, misleading state, and inaccessible paths;
2. missing loading, empty, error, success, disabled, and permission states;
3. flow, hierarchy, responsive, and design-system drift;
4. visual and motion inconsistencies;
5. code and asset cleanup.

Do not perfect one corner while leaving the rest below the same quality bar.

## 4. Polish the whole path

### Flow and hierarchy

- Match neighboring mental models, terminology, disclosure, routing, save behavior, and optimistic or pessimistic patterns.
- Make the primary task and current state obvious without flattening every element to equal weight.
- Ensure arrival, transition, empty, and recovery paths connect instead of behaving as isolated screens.

### Layout and type

- Align to the project's grid and spacing scale; fix optical as well as mathematical alignment.
- Group related content tightly and separate distinct groups generously.
- Keep same-role typography consistent; test measure, wrapping, localization expansion, zoom, and font loading.
- Verify every supported viewport rather than correcting only the current screenshot.

### Color, imagery, and icons

- Use semantic tokens and stable color meanings across themes.
- Verify text, control, and focus contrast in every state.
- Keep icon families, stroke/weight, sizing, and optical alignment coherent.
- Prevent image layout shift; use correct aspect ratios, responsive sources, and useful alt text.

### Interaction and state

- Every control needs appropriate default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error, and success behavior.
- Preserve visible keyboard focus, logical tab order, labels, and platform-appropriate touch targets.
- Keep motion coherent, interruptible, and performant. Do not add animation merely to make polish visible. Curves, durations, and springs come only from `references/core/params.md` (or the project's motion spec): replace any other value you find with the matching one. An action a person does 100+ times a day keeps press feedback only. How to write or fix the motion: `references/build/web.md`.
- Validate long, missing, localized, offline, slow, and permission-limited content where the product can encounter it.

### Content and code

- Keep terminology, capitalization, punctuation, and factual copy consistent. Ask before changing claims.
- Remove debug output, dead code, unused imports, obsolete styles, and polish-created duplication.
- Replace custom implementations with shared components where the system owns the pattern.
- Promote genuinely reusable values to tokens; do not create a system abstraction for one local exception.

## 5. Verify and finish

Walk the complete path again with mouse, keyboard, and touch where applicable. Check:

- mobile, intermediate, and wide layouts on the web; phone and tablet size classes in both supported orientations on native;
- loading, empty, error, success, disabled, long-content, and missing-content states;
- zoom, contrast, focus, semantics, and screen-reader names;
- console errors, layout shift, interaction latency, and image loading everywhere; supported browsers on the web; supported OS versions, runtime warnings, and dropped frames on native;
- agreement with DESIGN.md, neighboring features, and the user's scope.

Walk the Verify list in [craft-floor.md](craft-floor.md) by eye on screenshots at 1440px and 390px wide, then run the project's own QA commands when it has them. Fix real defects and document only narrow intentional exceptions. A clean scan does not replace visual judgment.

Finish with a source diff: remove accidental churn, orphaned code, redundant values, and temporary artifacts. Ship only when the feature is functionally complete and consistently finished across the path.

When this pass is done, close the backlog in the reply: list each finding it took on as fixed, deferred (with the reason), or still open. Nothing needs closing on disk.
